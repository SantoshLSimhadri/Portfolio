## Professional experience

## Business Analyst at First Community Bank,Utah 
   Oct 2024 - Present
   
   
In my current role at First Community Bank, I am leading critical analytics initiatives focused on real-time fraud monitoring and credit underwriting improvements. This position has allowed me to directly impact the bank's risk management strategies while working closely with risk, compliance, and data science teams.
My primary achievement has been utilizing SQL to extract, cleanse, and transform over 25 million transactional records from multiple legacy banking platforms. This massive data processing effort laid the foundation for sophisticated fraud detection models. I led the statistical analysis effort using Python (Pandas, SciPy, NumPy) to implement regression modeling, hypothesis testing, and time series forecasting, successfully identifying behavioral fraud patterns that were previously undetected.
To ensure insights were accessible to executive stakeholders, I developed and maintained interactive Power BI dashboards that visualize transaction anomalies, fraud heatmaps, and credit score performance trends. These visualizations have become essential tools for daily decision-making across the organization. Additionally, I collaborated with model validation teams using SAS and R to calibrate fraud scoring algorithms, ensuring our outputs aligned with regulatory reporting standards including Basel III and CCAR requirements.
The impact of this work has been substantial – my recommendations enabled a 22% reduction in fraud losses and streamlined the credit risk assessment cycle by 15%, representing millions in saved revenue and improved operational efficiency.

## Business Analyst at Tenneco 
   Oct 2023 - Sep 2024
   
   
During my tenure at Tenneco, I led end-to-end analytics efforts across cross-functional teams including engineering, quality assurance, and dealer operations. The focus was on redefining warranty analytics and improving data accessibility across the organization.
I wrote advanced SQL queries and utilized Hadoop and Spark to process high-volume claims, parts data, and IoT telemetry from connected vehicles. This big data approach allowed us to handle the massive scale of automotive data while maintaining performance. Using R and SPSS, I conducted regression and correlation analysis that uncovered early-life failures tied to specific environmental conditions and part suppliers – insights that directly influenced manufacturing decisions.
A key deliverable was designing and publishing interactive Tableau and Power BI dashboards to monitor defect rates, recall coverage, and supplier performance KPIs. These dashboards transformed how the organization tracked quality metrics. I also established a statistical process control (SPC) framework to track manufacturing variation and implement early warning thresholds, preventing quality issues before they reached customers.
The solution contributed to a 14% annual reduction in warranty payouts and significantly improved recall campaign precision and customer satisfaction scores.

## Data Analyst at Cognizant 
   April 2021 - July 2023
   
   
At Cognizant, I defined and executed a full-scale customer segmentation strategy for a major e-commerce client. Using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib) and SQL, I grouped users based on lifecycle stage, purchase frequency, and product affinities, creating actionable customer profiles that drove personalized marketing strategies.
I designed and evaluated A/B and multivariate tests on homepage personalization, dynamic pricing, and email campaign timing. Using Stata and Seaborn, I interpreted statistical significance to ensure our recommendations were data-driven and reliable. The integration of purchase, clickstream, and marketing data using Google Cloud Analytics allowed me to optimize queries and pipelines to support real-time recommendation feeds.
My Tableau dashboards for conversion funnel performance, campaign ROI, churn tracking, and cohort behavior analysis became essential tools for the product and growth teams. By partnering closely with these teams, I helped launch personalization features that drove a 19% increase in revenue per session and improved cart abandonment recovery by 11%. My data-driven recommendations were incorporated into the quarterly product roadmap, demonstrating the strategic value of analytics.

## Data Analyst at Noah Technologies 
   Oct 2019 - March 2021
   
   
At TCS, I performed root cause analysis on vehicle warranty claims and quality issues using statistical methods and machine learning algorithms. This analytical approach identified manufacturing defects that saved $3M annually in recall costs. I created automated reporting solutions using VBA and Excel macros to track dealer inventory levels, sales velocity, and parts demand forecasting across 500+ dealership locations nationwide.
Utilizing Teradata and SSAS, I mined customer feedback data from surveys, social media, and call centers, uncovering insights that drove product feature enhancements and improved Net Promoter Score by 15 points. I also conducted market competitive analysis using web scraping techniques and external data sources to benchmark pricing strategies, feature offerings, and market share trends across vehicle segments.
My partnership with manufacturing teams to optimize production scheduling through demand forecasting models resulted in reducing inventory holding costs by 18% while maintaining optimal stock levels for high-demand models.

## Analytics Intern at Hero MotoCorp 
   Feb 2019 - Sep 2019

   
As an Analytics Intern at Hero MotoCorp, I supported the sales analytics team in creating weekly performance reports tracking dealer-wise sales volumes, model distribution, and regional market penetration across 6,000+ touchpoints using Excel and SQL. I assisted in analyzing customer demographics and purchase patterns to understand buyer profiles and financing preferences across different motorcycle segments, contributing to targeted marketing strategies.
I collected competitor intelligence including pricing data, promotional campaigns, and new launches while developing visualization templates for monthly business reviews highlighting sales trends and seasonal patterns. My preliminary analysis on warranty claims and service feedback data identified quality improvement opportunities, supporting initiatives that reduced common issues by 10%.
